My name is Alex, I live in Kyiv, Ukraine. I built this website to make it easier to show my achievements and skills to people that might be interested. I started to do PC repair as a part-time job, and looking at all the stories about scammers in this field, I think that this website itself can show my credibility. 

I do programming since the age of 10, and since then I built a lot of (mainly unfinished and lost to time) projects in a lot of fields, spanning from web design to game development. The projects you can see in their respective tab are the most valuable to me.

I have a lot of hobbies. The main ones:
1. Photography. I started with an old Samsung PL60 (now considered vintage), and loved the grainy, foggy, uncertain feel that the photos taken on it had. In September 2024 I got a Canon EOS 60D, which isn't the latest and greatest, but still a proper DSLR. I also shoot with my phone when it's appropriate, after all, it's the photographer, not the gear.
2. Sailing. My dad got me into this a while ago. I like the overall feeling of leveraging the wind, it's... therapeutic. Sadly, it's limited to the warmer months.
3. Cycling. Not the competitive kind. I combine it with photography, it's very convenient to be able to take a picture of the same sunset in places that are a kilometer apart. Some of my best pictures were taken on spontaneous bike rides. Photography aside, I just like to explore new places and going down unknown forest paths. A bike is perfect for that.
4. Guitar. Started learning in July 2024.
